description: Coordinate multiple agents for complex multi-domain tasks. Use for comprehensive reviews or cross-stack implementation.
argument-hint: <task to orchestrate>
tier: HEAVY
tier-rationale: Contract guarantees ≥3 agents with 2-phase Plan→approve→Implement; parallel fan-out.
estimated-tokens: "80k–250k"
risk: Broad tasks ("review the whole repo") can pull 5+ agents; always the most expensive command in the kit.

# /orchestrate — Multi-Agent Orchestration

You are now in **ORCHESTRATION MODE**. Your task: coordinate specialized agents to solve this complex problem.

## Task

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Setup

**Step 0 — Parse bypass flag.**
If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `--yes` or `-y`, set `bypass = true` and strip the flag.

**Step 0b — Render the HEAVY gate (skip if `bypass`).**

```
⚖️  Kit dispatch preview — /kit:orchestrate

Task: "<stripped args>"

Planned agents: kit:project-planner + kit:explorer-agent (Phase 1)
                ≥3 specialists from the selection matrix (Phase 2)
Planned skills: kit:parallel-agents, kit:plan-writing + domain skills per selected agents

Tier: HEAVY  (80k–250k tokens, ~8–20 min wall-clock)
Why:  2-phase plan+implement with ≥3 agents; parallel fan-out in Phase 2.
Risk: Broad tasks pull 5+ agents and exceed the upper bound — scope tightly.

MoSCoW for this task:
  MUST    — plan file written and user-approved, ≥3 agents dispatched, report generated
  SHOULD  — validation scripts run (lint, security)
  COULD   — additional specialists for edge cases
  WON'T   — autonomous re-planning after Phase 2 starts without a new approval

Alternatives:
  (a) Proceed with full 2-phase orchestration                  ~80k–250k
  (b) Plan-only: Phase 1 only, stop for review                 ~20k–50k  (≈MEDIUM)
  (c) /kit:enhance for a single-agent targeted change          ~50k–150k

Reply:  go / a   — full orchestration
        b        — plan only
        cancel
```

On cancel: write a cancelled entry to `.kit/usage.json` (see write step below), print `🚫 Cancelled. No agents dispatched.` and stop.

## 🔴 Minimum Agent Requirement

> **ORCHESTRATION = MINIMUM 3 DIFFERENT AGENTS**
>
> Fewer than 3 ≠ orchestration — it's just delegation.
>
> Before completion: count invoked agents. If `< 3` → invoke more or run validation scripts.

### Agent Selection Matrix

| Task Type | Minimum Agents |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Web App** | frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, test-engineer |
| **API (Python/FastAPI)** | backend-specialist, database-architect, security-auditor |
| **API (Node)** | backend-specialist, security-auditor, test-engineer |
| **UI / Design** | frontend-specialist, seo-specialist, performance-optimizer |
| **Database** | database-architect, backend-specialist, security-auditor |
| **Full Stack** | project-planner, frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, devops-engineer |
| **Debug** | debugger, explorer-agent, test-engineer |
| **Security Audit** | security-auditor, penetration-tester, devops-engineer |
| **LLM Feature** | backend-specialist, test-engineer, performance-optimizer |

---

## 🔴 2-Phase Protocol

### PHASE 1: Planning (Sequential)

| Step | Agent | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `project-planner` | Create `docs/PLAN-{slug}.md` |
| 2 | (optional) `explorer-agent` | Deep codebase discovery |

> NO OTHER AGENTS DURING PLANNING.

### ⏸ Checkpoint: User Approval

```
Plan ready: docs/PLAN-{slug}.md
Approve? (Y/N)
  Y → implementation
  N → revise
```

> Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 without explicit approval.

### PHASE 2: Implementation (Parallel)

Run independent agents in PARALLEL (one assistant turn, multiple `Agent` tool calls):

| Wave | Agents |
|------|--------|
| Foundation | database-architect, security-auditor |
| Core | backend-specialist, frontend-specialist |
| Polish | test-engineer, devops-engineer |

## Kit Agents (20)

`orchestrator`, `project-planner`, `product-manager`, `product-owner`, `security-auditor`, `penetration-tester`, `backend-specialist`, `frontend-specialist`, `mobile-developer`, `database-architect`, `test-engineer`, `qa-automation-engineer`, `devops-engineer`, `performance-optimizer`, `debugger`, `code-archaeologist`, `explorer-agent`, `documentation-writer`, `seo-specialist`, `game-developer`

See the `parallel-agents` skill for the full capability matrix.

---

## Context Passing (MANDATORY)

When invoking any subagent, include:

1. **Original User Request** — full text
2. **Decisions Made** — answers to Socratic questions
3. **Previous Agent Work** — summary
4. **Current Plan State** — reference or excerpt of `PLAN-{slug}.md`

Example:

```
Agent(subagent_type="backend-specialist", prompt="""
CONTEXT:
- User Request: "Add rate limiting to the LLM gateway"
- Decisions: token bucket, Redis backend, 60 req/min per user
- Previous Work: project-planner wrote docs/PLAN-rate-limit.md with 4 tasks
- Plan State: Tasks 1-2 done (schema, middleware skeleton); Tasks 3-4 remaining

TASK: Implement tasks 3 and 4 from PLAN-rate-limit.md. Use the fastapi-expert skill.
""")
```

Never invoke a subagent without this context — it will re-derive things and make wrong assumptions.

---

## Verification (Final Step)

After implementation, run appropriate validation scripts:

```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/vulnerability-scanner/scripts/security_scan.py .
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/lint-and-validate/scripts/lint_runner.py .
```

## Output Format

## 🎼 Orchestration Report

### Task
[Summary]

### Agents Invoked (≥3)
| # | Agent | Focus | Status |
|---|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | project-planner | Plan | ✅ |
| 2 | backend-specialist | API routes | ✅ |
| 3 | test-engineer | Coverage | ✅ |

### Scripts Run
- security_scan.py → Pass
- lint_runner.py → Pass

### Key Findings
1. [Agent 1]: finding
2. [Agent 2]: finding
3. [Agent 3]: finding

### Deliverables
- [x] PLAN-{slug}.md
- [x] Code implemented
- [x] Tests passing

### Summary
[One-paragraph synthesis]
```

## Exit Gate

Before marking complete:

1. ✅ `agents_invoked >= 3`
2. ✅ At least one validation script ran
3. ✅ Orchestration Report generated

> If any fails → keep going. Do not close the loop.

## Write usage log (MANDATORY — use the Write tool, do not skip)

Path: `.kit/usage.json` in the **user's current working directory** (their project), NOT inside `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.

1. Read `.kit/usage.json` if it exists → parse the JSON. If absent → start with `{"runs": []}`.
2. Append one entry to `runs`:
   - `id`: `"r_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<NNN>"` (today + zero-padded seq = existing length + 1)
   - `started_at` / `ended_at`: ISO-8601 UTC, `command`: `"/kit:orchestrate"`, `args`: stripped args
   - `tier_declared`: `"HEAVY"`, `tier_observed`: recomputed from output size
   - `approved`: `true` (or `false` if cancelled), `chosen_alternative`: `"a"` | `"b"` | `null`
   - `agents`: array of `{"name": "kit:<name>", "approx_tokens": <N>}` for every agent dispatched
   - `skills`: skills consumed, `files_written`: integer, `approx_total_tokens`: sum across agents
   - `user_verdict`: `null`, `notes`: `null`
3. Write the updated JSON back using the **Write tool**.
